# Collection of nice LaTeX notes and problem sets.

Specifically, are notes and solutions are from math classes I have taken or am taking at USC.

Some facts:
- I am currently taking 3 four hundred level math classes in my freshman year.
- I record all my finished work in LaTeX because it leaves me feeling satisfied.
- I like ducks.
