Exercises 3, 8, 20, 23, 25, pp. 40-41;

\begin{enumerate}
    \item [3.] ($\Rightarrow$): If $H$ is abelian, then for any $a, b \in G$, $\varphi(ab) = \varphi(a)\varphi(b) = \varphi(b)\varphi(a) = \varphi(ba)$, where we use all our hypotheses. But $\varphi$ is injective, so $ab = ba$. Hence $G$ is abelian.
    
    ($\Leftarrow$): If $G$ is abelian, then do the same argument with $\varphi^{-1}$. For any $a, b \in H$, $\varphi^{-1}(ab) = \varphi^{-1}(a) \varphi^{-1}(b) = \varphi^{-1}(b)\varphi^{-1}(a) = \varphi^{-1}(ba)$. Now $\varphi^{-1}$ is injective, so $G$ is abelian.
    \item [8.] The orders of $S_n$ and $S_m$ are $n!$ and $m!$, respectively. Since sizes are non-equal so there cannot exist a bijection between $S_n$ and $S_m$.
    
    \item [20.] We prove the group axioms for $\text{Aut}(G)$.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textit{Identity}: Let $\text{id}_G : G \to G$ be the identity. Clearly for any $\varphi \in \text{Aut}(G)$, $\varphi \circ \text{id}_G = \text{id}_G \circ \varphi = \varphi$. Hence $\text{id}_G$ is the identity. 
        \item \textit{Associativity}: Note that function composition is associative, so multiplication in $\text{Aut}(G)$ is by definition associative.
        \item \textit{Closure}: We need to prove that for any $\varphi, \phi \in \text{Aut}(G)$, $\varphi \circ \phi \in \text{Aut}(G)$. Indeed, if $\varphi$ and $\phi$ are isomorphisms, then for any $g, h \in G$, $\varphi(\phi(gh)) = \varphi(\phi(g)\phi(b)) = \varphi(\phi(g)) \varphi(\phi(h))$. Hence $\varphi \circ \phi$ is a homomorphism. Furthermore, the composition of two bijections is a bijection, so $\varphi \circ \phi$ is a isomorphism as well.
        \item \textit{Inverses}: If $\varphi \in \text{Aut}(G)$, then the function inverse $\varphi^{-1} G \to G$ is also the inverse of $\varphi$ in $\text{Aut}(G)$.
