\begin{theorem}[1]
    Prove that convergence of \(\{s_n\}\) implies convergence of \(\{|s_n|\}\). Is the converse true?
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[2]
    Calculate \(\lim_{n \to \infty} (\sqrt{n^2 + n} - n)\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[3]
    If \(s_1 = \sqrt 2\), and 
    \[s_{n + 1} = \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{s_n}} \hspace{2em} (n = 1, 2, 3, \dots),\]
    prove that \(\{s_n\}\) converges, and that \(s_n < 2\) for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \dots\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[4]
    Find the upper and lower limits of the sequence \(\{s_n\}\) defined by
    \[s_1 = 0; \hspace{2em} s_{2m} = \frac{s_{2m - 1}}{2}; \hspace{2em} s_{2m + 1} = \frac{1}{2} + s_{2m}.\]
