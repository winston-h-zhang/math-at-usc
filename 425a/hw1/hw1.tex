\begin{theorem}[1]
    If $r$ is rational $(r \neq 0)$ and $x$ is irrational, prove that $r + x$ and $rx$ are irrational.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    We prove the contrapositive of both statements. 

    If $r$ is rational and $r + x$ is rational, then we may express both as fractions $r = a / b$ and $r + x = c / d$. Hence $x = (r + x) - x = c / d - a / b = (cb - ad) / bd$, which is clearly rational. Thus completes the first proof.
    
    If $r$ is rational and $rx$ is rational, then again write $r = a / b$ and $rx = c/d$. So then $x = rx / r = (ca)/(bd)$, which is again rational, as desired.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[2]
    Prove that there is no rational number whose square is 12.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Assume for the sake of contradiction that there exists some $q \in \mathbb Q$ such that $q^2 = 12$. Then $4 \mid q^2 \implies 2 \mid q$. Hence write $q = 2p$, and substitute to simplify $4p^2 = 12 \implies p^2 = 3$. Now $p$ is rational so we can write it as a reduced fraction $a / b$. 

    Then $a^2/b^2= 3$, implying $a^2= 3b^2$. This is an equation over the integers, so 3 must divide $a$. Write $a = a'/3$. Substitiuting, we have another integer equation $3a'^2= b^2$. By the same logic, 3 divides $b$. But now we conclude that 3 is a common factor of $a$ and $b$, contradicting our assumption that $a/b$ is reduced!
    
    Hence such a $q$ cannot exist.
\end{proof}
