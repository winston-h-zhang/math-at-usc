\begin{theorem}[5]
    For any two real sequences \(\{a_n\}, \{b_n\}\), prove that 
    \[\limsup_{n \to \infty} (a_n + b_n) \le \limsup_{n \to \infty} a_n + \limsup_{n \to \infty} b_n.\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[7]
    Prove that the convergence of \(\sum a_n\) implies the convergence of 
    \[\sum \frac{\sqrt{a_n}}{n},\]
    if \(a_n \ge 0\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[8]
    If \(\sum a_n\) converges, and if \(\{b_n\}\) is monotonic and bounded, prove that \(\sum a_n b_n\) converges. 
\end{theorem}
