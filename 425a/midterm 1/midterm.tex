\begin{theorem}[1]
    If \(x \in \mathbb R^k\), \(k \ge 2\), show that there exists \(y \in \mathbb R^k\) such that \(x \cdot y = 0\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    One possible solution is simply \(y = 0\); hence trivially \(x \cdot y = 0\). But that's not very interesting so I'll give a nontrivial example.

    If \(x\) is trivial then \(y\) can be anything, so assume that \(x\) is nontrivial. Then there is at least one index \(i\) where \(x_i \neq 0\). Since \(n \ge 2\), pick some \(j \neq i\). Set \(y_i = -x_j\) and \(y_j = x_i\), and \(y_k = 0\) for all \(k \neq i\) and \(k \neq j\). Hence this defines \(y\) as nontrivial. Then 
    \[x \cdot y = \sum_{k = 1}^n x_k y_k = x_i y_i + x_j + y_j = - x_i x_j + x_j x_i = 0.\]
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[2]
    True or False: If true prove it, if false counterexample it.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item [(a)] Let \(\{F_n\}\) be a countable collection of closed subset of \(\mathbb R\) such that for any finite sub-collection 
        \[F_{n_1} \cap F_{n_2} \cap \dots \cap F_{n_k} \neq \varnothing.\]
        Then 
        \[\bigcap_{n = 1}^\infty F_n \neq \varnothing.\]
        \item [(b)] Add the condition that each \(F_n\) is bounded and repost (2a).
        \item [(c)] Repeat (2a) where closed and bounded \(F_n \subseteq X\), and arbitrary metric space.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Part (a):
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[3]
    Consider the metric space \(\mathbb Q\) of all rationals on the real line with the Euclidean metric. Prove that if \(K \neq \varnothing\) is a compact subset of \(\mathbb Q\) then \(K\) cannot contain an open subset of \(\mathbb Q\). \textit{Hint: Consider the relative topology.}
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    Let \(F\) and \(K\) be nonempty closed subsets of the metric space \(X\) with \(K \cap F = \varnothing\). Show that if \(K\) is compact there is a positive distance from \(F\) to \(K\), i.e.
    \[\inf\{d(x, y) | x \in F, y \in K\} = \delta > 0.\]
    Is is still true if \(K\) is only assumed to be closed? If not find a counterexample.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[4]
    A \textit{base} for a topological space \(X\) is a collection \(\{V_{\alpha} | \alpha \in A\}\) of open subsets of \(X\) such that for every open subset of \(G \subseteq X\), one has \(G = \bigcup_{\alpha \in \mathcal B} V_{\alpha}\) where \(\mathcal B \subseteq \mathcal A\).

    Prove that every compact metric space \(X\) has a countable base.
\end{theorem}
